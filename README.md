PhantomJS Windows/Mac OS X/Linux native binary embedder

Selenium 2 has annoying habit of wanting full path to browser binary. For headless browsers that do not need any installation and can be placed anywhere like PhantomJS, this is simply unacceptable and action is unevitable!

Another obstacle usualy is different Operating System between developer (MacOS, Windows) and continuous integration server (Linux). Because PhantomJS is native library therefore every OS needs particular executable binary

Phanbedder to the rescue! TODO showcase
